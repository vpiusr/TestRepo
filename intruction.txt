My work on test is done and I am ready to merge it back to master. Here are the two ways I can think of:

A:

git checkout test
git pull origin master
git push origin test
git checkout master
git pull origin test 
B:

git checkout test
git pull origin master
git checkout master
git merge test
I am not using --rebase because from my understanding, rebase will get the changes from master and stack mine on top of that hence it could overwrite changes other people made.

Question 2: Which one of these two methods is right? What is the difference there?

The goal in all of this is to keep my test branch updated with the things happening in master and later I could merge them back into master hoping to keep the timeline as linear as possible.
